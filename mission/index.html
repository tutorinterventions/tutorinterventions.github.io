<p>Tutor Interventions came to fruition in April 2018, because I wanted to spend my time teaching students who needed support, as opposed to other increasing demands placed upon a teacher within a school environment. Building positive relationships with students is important! Making progress and moving towards mastery for the student&#39;s benefit, not for statistics or shareholders.</p>
<p>Each session is spent focusing on the student&#39;s needs and requirements, using a multi-sensory approach and a variety of strategies and resources. These can include the use of games, puzzles and the online learning spaces – <a href="http://uk.mathletics.com/">Mathletics</a> and <a href="http://uk.spellodrome.com/#/home">Spellodrome</a>.</p>
