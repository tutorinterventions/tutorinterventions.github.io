<p>Rachael is an amazing tutor who cares about her students&#39; progression. She spends her time finding extra resources and emails them,  which I found really helpful. Her technique of teaching is outstanding as it&#39;s easy to understand, she also takes her time explaining in detail things which I do not understand. Her way of teaching has made me improve and has led me to do well on my GCSEs. </p>
