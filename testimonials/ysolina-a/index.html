<p>Thank you so much for all your help and support with my son&#39;s preparation for the GCSE English Language and Literature. Your patience (with both of us!), flexibility, teaching style and subject knowledge were second to none. Despite all the challenges (and there were a few!) so much progress was made and my son again feels confident in his abilities once again. Thank you so much! </p>
