<p>This is my second lesson with Rachael. She is very professional and organised. In the hour she’s here they get a lot done. My son is also very happy being tutored by Rachael.</p>

<p>Great tutor committed to my daughter and able to manage her complex needs using different techniques and humour.
My daughter can be difficult to engage/encourage and has low self-esteem, with Rachael’s support she is learning and her confidence is growing and showing through already.</p>
