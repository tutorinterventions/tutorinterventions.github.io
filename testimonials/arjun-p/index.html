<p>I would like to send a massive thank you to Rachael for teaching me how to answer key questions and what to understand and interpret from them. I used to struggle with English a lot, but thanks to Rachael’s help I’ve never felt more confident to answer any exam questions they throw at me. She teaches you in a way that you will always remembers and does not stop until you have fully understood it. </p>
